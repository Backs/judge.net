# Contributing
I'm looking for any help with this project. Especially with a frontend.

Here is my future vision of the project for some period. If you are interested in it, you can write me: [rogatnev.sergey@gmail.com](mailto:rogatnev.sergey@gmail.com)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Migrate backend to .net 6 or .net 8.
- [ ] Migrate frontend to React/Angular.
- [ ] Add openId providers.
- [ ] Rewrite JudgeService (replace `run.exe`).
- [ ] Docker support.
- [ ] PostgreSQL support.
